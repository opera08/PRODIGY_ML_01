House Price Prediction Project:
This project uses the dataset from kaggle to predict house prices using an XGBoost Regressor model. The implementation is done in Google Colab.

To get started, open the project in Google Colab and install the necessary dependencies.
 Import the datasets from CSV files.
Preprocess Data: Handle missing values, merge datasets, and check for duplicates.
Train Model by splitting the data into training and test sets, then train the XGBoost Regressor and Calculate R-squared error and mean absolute error for the training data.
Visualize Results by Plotting actual prices vs. predicted prices.
The Data Files used are,
train.csv: Training dataset and 
sample_submission.csv: Sample submission file
